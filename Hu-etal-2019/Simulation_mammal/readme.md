The folder contains simulation data and results. **simu_500_200_diffr_2-1.bed** and **simu_500_200_diffr_2-\*.fasta** are input data. 2-* corresponds to: 0) all lineages conserved; 1) cetaceans (dolphin and killer whales) accelerated; 2) pinnipeds (seal and walrus) accelerated; 3) manatee, seal and dolphin accelerated, i.e. one species from each of the three independent lineages; 4) all 5 marine mammals accelerated; 5) pinnipeds and panda accelerated; 7) species descending from the common ancestor of cat and pinnipeds. All scenarios share the same bed file.
In the bed file, the 1th column is element name (ID); the 2nd and 3rd columns are start and end positions in the alignment for each element; the 6th and 7th columns are conserved and accelerated rates to generate the DNA sequences for that element. 
Results from PhyloAcc are shown in [result_phyloAcc/](https://github.com/xyz111131/PhyloAcc/tree/master/Simulation_mammal/result_phyloAcc). Results from phyloP are in  [result_phyloP/](https://github.com/xyz111131/PhyloAcc/tree/master/Simulation_mammal/result_phyloP). Input files and Results using PAML and phytools are in [PAML/](https://github.com/xyz111131/PhyloAcc/tree/master/Simulation_mammal/PAML).

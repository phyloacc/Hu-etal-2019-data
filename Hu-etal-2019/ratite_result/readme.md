The fold contains results for testing ratite specific accelerated CNEEs:

**Combined_elem_lik2-1.txt** is the marginal loglikelihoods under null, accelerated and full models.

**top_20_0_post_Z_1-1.txt** is the posterior probabilities of Z and posterior median of all parameters for ratite-specific accelerated CNEEs (logBF1 > 20 & logBF2>0).
